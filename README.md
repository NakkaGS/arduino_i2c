## Arduino Mega - Master i2C + LCD
Receive data from the the Slaves and show in LCD

## Arduino UNO - Slave i2C + Weather Station
It has Huminity Sensor and Raining Sensor. It sends these datas to the Master.

## Arduino Nano - Slave i2C + Distance Sensors
It has Distance Sensors. It sends the data to the Master
